\f0\fs26 \cf2 \cb3 In the street we have List of vehicle objects and list of TrafficLight objects.\
Vehicle is super class and car, truck and tractor-trailor class are subclasses of Vehicle class.\
Program design:\
Our vehicles are dependent on vehicle in front and list of positions of (unselected) red traffic lights.\
Vehicle is subscribed to the vehicle which is just in front of it. \
Vehicle which is ahead of current vehicle publishes its rear position and its velocity to vehicle following it.\
All vehicles subscribe to the traffic light and traffic light publishes its position, if traffic light's color is red and it is unselected.\
Traffic Light publishes a message to remove its position to all its subscribed vechicles.\
Our street extends infinitely in both directions}
